# Hackable Presentations

Teaching web security? Save yourself some time and just combine your hands-on hacking with your online presentation. What could go wrong!

This web server displays a [reveals.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation controllable by the presenter. Folks seeing the presentation can also access a set of security challenges that involve hacking the presentation in some way- doing so will create an achievement on the presenter's screen! There's also a chat and some other nice features to make for a better presentation experience.
